# DEN-MLR-Model

### Problem Statement: 
#### Assess patterns and correlation in non-airline revenue factors collected at DEN (Denver International Airport). Using data accrued from January 2012 - June 2017, create a method for forecasting non-airline revenues. Use it to produce forecasts for the months of March through June of 2017, and compare with the real observations to check your model performance.

#### First we can look at our goals:
*On top of predicting total non-airline revenue as a comprehensive response variable, we looked at each of the dependent variables independently.
