# DEN-MLR-Model

### Problem Statement: 
#### Assess patterns and correlation in non-airline revenue factors collected at DEN (Denver International Airport). Using data accrued from January 2012 - June 2017, create a method for forecasting non-airline revenues. Use it to produce forecasts for the months of March through June of 2017, and compare with the real observations to check your model performance.

#### First we can look at our goals:
*On top of predicting total non-airline revenue as a comprehensive response variable, we looked at each of the dependent variables independently.

#### We then looked at the data as a whole to gain an idea of the different variables and observation values:

#### We used the following libraries to perform the EDA: 
- dplyr
- data.table
- tidyr
- janitor
- reshape2
- stats
- ggplot2
